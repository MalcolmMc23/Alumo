You’re setting up ONLYOFFICE Document Server on your server (via Docker) to integrate with your Next.js application, with the ultimate goal of allowing users to upload, open, and edit .docx files right in the browser—without losing any formatting. By doing this, you can embed an Office-like editor into your web app, so that after users upload a Word document, they can make changes directly online and then save or export their updated .docx file, all while preserving the original formatting.
