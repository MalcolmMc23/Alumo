1. Overview
   Alumo is a web-based, AI-powered career center platform designed to help college students streamline their job searches and connect with alumni. Its primary features include a robust alumni database, personalized résumé/LinkedIn/cover-letter advice, job listings, and cold email outreach.

2. Hosting & Infrastructure
   Cloud Provider: Hetzner

Hetzner provides virtual private servers or dedicated servers to run Alumo’s infrastructure.
Container Management: Coolify

Simplifies deployments by containerizing services and managing them in a straightforward GUI.
Deployment Model:

Docker images for each service (frontend, backend, database) to ensure consistency across environments.
CI/CD pipeline triggered on code pushes for automated testing and container builds.

3. Frontend Stack
   Framework: Next.js / React

Combines React’s component-based architecture with Next.js for server-side rendering and improved performance.
Facilitates SEO for public-facing parts of the platform (e.g., landing pages).
Styling & UI:

Could use a design system library (e.g., Material-UI) or custom styling with CSS/Sass to maintain brand consistency.
Key Responsibilities:

Rendering job listings, alumni profiles, and AI-driven résumé feedback.
Handling user interactions, search queries, and form submissions.

4.  Backend Stack
    Runtime & Framework: Node.js / Express (or Next.js API routes)

Houses RESTful APIs (or Next.js routes) to power the application layer.
Manages business logic for user authentication, alumni data retrieval, and cold-email sending.
Language: JavaScript/TypeScript

Ensures type safety and maintainability at scale.
API Integration:

Potential third-party job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed) to ingest or cross-reference job postings.
AI services for résumé/cover letter analysis and job recommendation logic.

5.  Database & Data Management
    Primary Database: PostgreSQL

Stores structured data such as user profiles, alumni records, job postings, and session information.
Ideal for relational queries, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
ORM/Query Builder Prisma

Simplifies database migrations and schema management.
Data Security:

Secure connections (SSL/TLS), hashed passwords, and role-based access controls.
Proper indexing and partitioning for performance on large data sets.

6. AI & Search Services
   AI Chatbot & Search:

Integrates with external large language models (OpenAI API, etc.) for advanced natural language understanding.
Allows semantic searching of alumni database (e.g., “Show me all alumni in tech marketing in San Francisco”).
Personalized Advice:

Analyzes résumé/LinkedIn text, offering user-specific recommendations.
Automates cold-email drafts and interview prep checklists.

7.  Authentication & Security
    Authentication:

OAuth login with google

Authorization & Role Management:

Encryption & Data Protection:

HTTPS for all data-in-transit, strong encryption for sensitive fields (e.g., email addresses).

8. Email & Communication

Sends personalized cold emails to alumni using dynamic templates.
Delivers platform notifications (e.g., job alerts, direct messages).
Messaging & Alerts:

9.  Analytics & Monitoring
    User Analytics: Google Analytics / Plausible / Custom Dashboard

Tracks user behavior, conversion funnels (e.g., how many students schedule calls with alumni), and feature usage.
Performance & Error Monitoring:

Tools like Sentry or New Relic to capture errors and performance bottlenecks.
Logging & metrics (e.g., via Grafana and Prometheus) for server health and database performance.

10. Future Considerations
    Mobile App: While currently out of scope, the Next.js/React codebase can be adapted for mobile with React Native in the future.
    Integration with University Systems: Potential single sign-on (SSO) solutions or course management data.
    Advanced AI: Continuous improvement of recommendation engines (résumé feedback, job matching, etc.) as large language models evolve.
