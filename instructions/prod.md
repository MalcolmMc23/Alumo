1. App Overview
   Alumo is a digital, agentic career center aimed at improving the job-hunting experience for college students. Unlike traditional career services that often provide generic, one-size-fits-all advice, Alumo focuses on personalized connections between students and alumni and personalied career services, enabling more impactful networking opportunities and better hiring outcomes.

Primary Objectives
Facilitate Student-Alumni Connections: Provide a structured yet intuitive way for students to identify and reach out to alumni in their desired career paths.
Improve Job Application Success Rates: Offer job listings, personalized résumé/cover letter/LinkedIn advice, and strategic tips to increase the likelihood of successful applications.
Enhance Career Support for Universities: Serve as a modern, data-driven supplement (or alternative) to existing university career services, providing deeper analytics and targeted interventions.
Target Audience
College Students: Primarily undergraduates and recent graduates who are actively seeking internships, part-time, or full-time positions.
Universities: Alumo’s clients are university career centers that want to provide enhanced alumni networking and job search tools for their students.
Problems to Solve
Generic Career Advice: Traditional services often provide templated information that does not address the individual student’s needs or industry focus.
Limited Alumni Engagement: Students often do not know how or whom to contact among alumni networks, missing crucial mentorship and referral opportunities.
Time-Consuming Job Search: Students need a centralized platform that consolidates job listings, personalized advice, and networking opportunities. 2. Tech Stack & APIs
Since Alumo will be a web-based platform initially, the proposed technology stack is as follows:

Front-End:

Framework/Library: NextJs/React.
UI/UX Design: Custom design system or a pre-existing UI framework (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap) for consistency.
Back-End:

Application Layer: Node.js/NextJs RESTful APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage (user profiles, job listings, alumni data).

Email Service: For sending out cold emails to alumni (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES).
Authentication: OAuth or custom JWT-based authentication for secure login.
Analytics & Tracking: Google Analytics or a custom analytics solution to track user engagement and system usage.
Third-Party Job Listings (Future Consideration): Integration with LinkedIn, Indeed, or other job boards via their public APIs, if licensing or partnerships allow. 3. Core Features
Language-Based Alumni Search:

A search module using AI where students can input keywords (e.g., industry, job title, location) and Alumo surfaces relevant alumni.
Potentially includes filters like graduation year, company, major, etc. This search feature should be a api call to some sort of AI services and with that it should call a function based on the information in the prompt.
Alumni Connectivity Tools:

Direct messaging or cold email templates that guide students to effectively contact alumni.
Calendar or scheduling feature for coffee chats (could integrate with third-party scheduling services like Calendly).
Job Search & Recommendations:

Display curated job listings relevant to the student’s major, interests, and search history.
Option for students to save/bookmark jobs or set alerts.
Personalized Career Advice:

Automated résumé and cover letter critiques using text analytics or AI api services.
Tips for optimizing LinkedIn profiles, including keyword usage and profile structure.
Checklists for interview preparation and networking best practices. 4. In-Scope and Out-of-Scope
In-Scope:

Development of a web-based platform for students and administrators.
Building a searchable alumni database with filtering capabilities.
Job listing and recommendation features.
Advanced AI-based career counseling beyond basic text analytics or keyword matching.
Personalized career advice (résumé, cover letter, LinkedIn).
Basic analytics for admins (e.g., how many alumni connections, job applications, etc.).
Out-of-Scope (for this initial phase):

Mobile applications (iOS, Android).
Detailed CRM or LMS functionalities (beyond student/alumni connections).
Payment/monetization features for students (the platform is presumably sponsored by universities).
Enterprise integrations with external HR systems or advanced job boards (e.g., Greenhouse, Workday) at this stage. 5. Non-Functional Requirements
Usability: The interface should be intuitive and accessible for a wide range of student users. Clear navigation, minimal clutter, and straightforward instructions.
Scalability: Should accommodate user growth (multiple universities, thousands of students/alumni). Ensure the database and architecture can be scaled easily (e.g., containerization with Docker/Kubernetes).
Security & Privacy: While there are no explicit compliance requirements such as GDPR/HIPAA, the platform must handle user data securely (e.g., password hashing, SSL/TLS encryption, secure email handling).
Performance: Reasonable response times (< 2-3 seconds) for critical operations like search and profile loading, under normal load.
Reliability: Aim for high availability, but no formal SLA is required. Basic monitoring and alerting should be in place. 6. Constraints & Assumptions
Budget and Timeline: No strict constraints have been identified; however, we assume a standard product development lifecycle.
User Data & Alumni Database: Initial alumni data may be manually obtained or purchased. Future expansions of the alumni database might require new data-acquisition strategies or partnerships.
Technical Stack: We assume a standard web stack with no requirement for specialized or emerging technologies beyond typical frameworks and APIs.
User Privacy & Consent: Ensuring alumni have opted in or are aware that their information is available to students. Mechanisms for alumni to opt out may be necessary. 7. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls
Alumni Database Acquisition:

Cost and Data Validity: Obtaining and maintaining a large, up-to-date database of alumni (including email addresses) can be expensive and time-consuming.
Email Consent: Risk of distributing alumni emails without explicit permission could lead to privacy and legal concerns.
User Adoption & Engagement:

Universities and students need clear value propositions for adopting the platform. Without adequate marketing or onboarding, the platform could remain underutilized.
Resource Constraints:

If the data acquisition cost grows significantly, product expansion may stall.
Limited engineering resources could slow development of new features.
Feature Overload:

Early-stage overcomplication might lead to confusion or usability issues. A lean MVP approach is advised.
Data Security:

Storage and transmission of sensitive personal information (alumni emails, job-seeking students’ data) requires robust security measures to avoid breaches.
